## 🗨 About Chess
Chess is a ***two-player abstract strategy board game.*** Each player controls **sixteen pieces** of six types on a chessboard. <br/>
Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The object of the game is to ***checkmate the opponent's king.*** <br/><br/>
❗ Checkmate occurs when a king is threatened with capture and **has no escape.** ❗ <br/><br/>
A game can end in various ways besides checkmate: a player can resign, and there are several ways a game can end in a draw. <br/>
There is one player with the ⚪ **white** pieces and one with the ⚫ **black** pieces. <br/><br/>

## 🌟 Basic Moves

### 👑 King (K)
- The king moves **exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.** A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player.

### 👑 Queen (Q)
- The queen moves **any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.**

### 🗼 Rook (R)
- A rook moves **any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically.** It also is moved when castling.

### 🏹 Bishop (B)
- A bishop moves **any number of vacant squares diagonally.** (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark squares, not both).

### 🐎 Knight (N)
- A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an "L" pattern. The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.

### ⚔ Pawn (P)
- A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
- A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when vacant except when capturing ***en passant.*** <br/><br/>
